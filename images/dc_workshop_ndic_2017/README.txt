Hi Tracy, 

I’m so glad you were able to come out to both teach and speak at NDIC! You’re presentation was great the workshop was wonderful. I’ve attached the photos from the workshop where we either have consent forms from everyone in the picture or their faces were too obscured to be identifiable by me (and I have a list of everyone who came and know what they look like, which probably means that they’re not identifiable by other people). Thanks again, Tracey. It was lovely to see you and tell your family that Colorado says hello and thanks to them as well. 

Take care, 

Shea
